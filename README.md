# Loose End

## Overview

Project 3 was my first experience of building a full stack application as part of a group (4 people). After a short amount of discussion we came up with the idea of building Loose End, a social app for users to add, share and review meet ups and points of interest, as well as organise groups with associated activities

Chheck out the final project [here](https://ja-loose-end.herokuapp.com/)

## The Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Technologies Used

### Back-end:
- Node.js
- Mongodb
- Express
- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- jsonwebtoken

### Frontend:
- React
- Axios
- Bulma
- SCSS
- Http-proxy-middleware
- Nodemon
- React Router Dom
- React Mapbox GL
- React Calendar
- React select

### Development tools:
- VS code
- NPM 
- Insomnia
- Git
- Github
- Google Chrome dev tools
- Heroku (deployment)

## Approach taken

## Day 1 - Planning

## Back-end - Day 2 & 3

## Front-end - Day 4, 5, 6, 7

## Deployment

The app was then deployed through Heroku. Initially we linked up the front-end to the back-end and tested locally, and once we were happy with this then hit the deploy button on Heroku through the CLI. Once the app was then deployed online we seeded in the relevent data.
